🧩 WHAT SKILLS YOU NEED (FULL MAP)

Here is a clear map of ALL skills you need for humanoid robotics:

🔵 1. Robotics Software (the brain)

You need to understand:

ROS2 (Robot Operating System)

nodes, topics, services, actions

sensor data streaming

real-time communication

safety constraints

ROS2 is mandatory — 95% of robotics companies use it.

🔵 2. AI + Computer Vision (the eyes)

Humanoid robots need:

object recognition

pose estimation

3D perception

depth estimation

human tracking

gesture detection

scene understanding

Tools to learn:

OpenCV

PyTorch

YOLOv8 / Segment Anything

3D vision models

🔵 3. Motion Planning (the muscles)

Robots need to move safely and efficiently:

kinematics

dynamics

inverse kinematics

trajectory planning

obstacle avoidance

locomotion algorithms

Libraries to know:

MoveIt 2

Drake

Isaac Sim

🔵 4. SLAM (the brain map)

SLAM = Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

Robots need to:

map environments

localize themselves

navigate freely

Tech:

Lidar SLAM

Visual SLAM (ORB-SLAM, VSLAM)

multi-sensor fusion

🔵 5. Embedded Systems (low-level control)

Not full hardware engineering — but enough to communicate with motors:

microcontrollers

motor drivers

actuators

real-time OS (RTOS)

embedded C++

🔵 6. Simulation (for development)

Simulation lets you build and test robots without hardware:

Gazebo Classic

Gazebo Fortress / Garden

Isaac Sim (NVIDIA)

Webots

Simulation skills are essential because humanoids are expensive to test physically.

⭐ THE GOOD NEWS

You do NOT need all skills at once.
You can grow step by step.

And because humanoid robotics is new, even companies don't expect you to be perfect.
They want enthusiastic engineers who can learn.

💰 INCOME POTENTIAL (REALISTIC NUMBERS)
